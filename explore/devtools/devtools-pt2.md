Q1  
The variables 'num1' and 'num2' are not converted to numbers before being added together. As a result, 'result' is assigned the concatenation of strings 'num1' and 'num2' and not the sum of 'num1' and 'num2.'  

Q2  
I would fix the issue by converting the inputs for 'num1' and 'num2' to numbers. This way, when 'result' is declared and assigned, 'num1 + num2' will be interpreted as an addition of two numbers instead of a concatenation of two strings.
